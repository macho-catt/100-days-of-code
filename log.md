# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 20, 2021 - May 24, 2021
#####

**Month's Progress**: Finished Harvard's CS50 online course, learned GitHub basics, started working on fcc certifications and currently working on the front end library cert. Started learning react by following facebook's tic-tac-toe tutorial. Then started going through fullstackopen's react courses (finished part 1). Also started reading The Modern JavaScript Tutorial on the side to supplement my coding. Finally, I started 100 Days of Code.

**Thoughts:** I started 100 Days of Code to log my progress and keep myself accountable. However, I actually started my journey last month on 4/20/2021. So far, I have coded at least 2 hours a day. I hope to keep this up!

### Day 1: May 25, 2021 
#####

**Today's Progress**: Started on part2 of fullstackopen and finished section a. Also re-arranged my github repos.

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of syntax trouble with the exercise for part 2 section a. Mostly because the notation gets confusing when you have a multi-depth object or array (or both). I also didn't realize that when you use map (or any array function) and return the array in the render section, the top level arrays need to have identifying keys. I thought lists only needed keys. This got even more complicated when you write each list as a component. So then you need to assign a key to the component, and not the list it creates. Anyway, I finished section b and got to the exercise section and decided to call it a day. 

I have a flight in two days to go home, so I've been deciding which coding activity I should save offline. I haven't formulated a plan yet, but I'm leaning towards finishing the fcc front end lesons tomorrow so I can work on the projects during the flight. I might also save some algorithm exercises, and maybe save the react exercises from full stack open.

### Day 2: May 26, 2021 
#####

**Today's Progress**: Finished exercises for part2 section b of fullstackopen. Started on part3.

**Thoughts:** I only had enough time today to finish the exercises for part2 section b. I'm still not used to setting up event handlers and states with hooks, but I think I'm getting the hang of it. I also prepared some things to work on during my flight tomorrow, like the rest of part2 plus some fcc exercises.

### Day 3: May 27, 2021 
#####

**Today's Progress**: Finished part2 section c and halfway through section d. Finished the first exercise of part2 section c. Finished fcc's redux lessons. Worked on fcc's project euler coding challenges.

**Thoughts:** Today was mostly travel. I finished the redux lesson on fcc, which is interesting considering I'm doing more exercises specifically on just react with fullstackopen. It will be interesting to see how those two work together. During the flight, I was working on the smallest multiple challenge for project euler. I didn't realize my VScode was out of date, so I couldn't launch the debugger during the flight. I had to stop working on the challenge because I couldn't debug properly. Instead, I went through fullstackopen and finished what I can. Interestingly, the section went over promises, which I just read about a couple days ago from the Modern Javascript Tutorial, so I was able to follow along.

I also found an HTML/CSS lesson online that is free: Interneting is hard. It looks very elegant and well made, so I might start reading that as well to practice my HTML/CSS skills, which is severely lacking compared to everything else.

Since today was mostly travel and catching up with my family, I might revisit some of the things I learned today just so I remember them.

### Day 4: May 28, 2021 
#####

**Today's Progress**: Finished all of part2 section c's exercises in fullstackopen. Finished all of part2 section d.

**Thoughts:** I went back and read over all of section c and d again just so I can retain the information. Then, I finished the last half of section c's exercise, which involved making API GET requests from third party websites. It was pretty cool getting data from another source and having it show up in something that you're working on. I also finished section d, which featured more RESTful API requests.
