# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 20, 2021 - May 24, 2021
#####

**Month's Progress**: Finished Harvard's CS50 online course, learned GitHub basics, started working on fcc certifications and currently working on the front end library cert. Started learning react by following facebook's tic-tac-toe tutorial. Then started going through fullstackopen's react courses (finished part 1). Also started reading The Modern JavaScript Tutorial on the side to supplement my coding. Finally, I started 100 Days of Code.

**Thoughts:** I started 100 Days of Code to log my progress and keep myself accountable. However, I actually started my journey last month on 4/20/2021. So far, I have coded at least 2 hours a day.

### Day 1: May 25, 2021 
#####

**Today's Progress**: Started on part2 of fullstackopen and finished section a. Also re-arranged my github repos.

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of syntax trouble with the exercise for part 2 section a. Mostly because the notation gets confusing when you have a multi-depth object or array (or both). I also didn't realize that when you use map (or any array function) and return the array in the render section, the top level arrays need to have identifying keys. I thought lists only needed keys. This got even more complicated when you write each list as a component. So then you need to assign a key to the component, and not the list it creates. Anyway, I finished section b and got to the exercise section and decided to call it a day. 

I have a flight in two days to go home, so I've been deciding which coding activity I should save offline. I haven't formulated a plan yet, but I'm leaning towards finishing the fcc front end lesons tomorrow so I can work on the projects during the flight. I might also save some algorithm exercises, and maybe save the react exercises from full stack open.

### Day 2: May 26, 2021 
#####

**Today's Progress**: Finished exercises for part2 section b of fullstackopen. Started on part3.

**Thoughts:** I only had enough time today to finish the exercises for part2 section b. I'm still not used to setting up event handlers and states with hooks, but I think I'm getting the hang of it. I also prepared some things to work on during my flight tomorrow, like the rest of part2 plus some fcc exercises.
