# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 20, 2021 - May 24, 2021
#####

**Month's Progress**: Finished Harvard's CS50 online course, learned GitHub basics, started working on fcc certifications and currently working on the front end library cert. Started learning react by following facebook's tic-tac-toe tutorial. Then started going through fullstackopen's react courses (finished part 1). Also started reading The Modern JavaScript Tutorial on the side to supplement my coding. Finally, I started 100 Days of Code.

**Thoughts:** I started 100 Days of Code to log my progress and keep myself accountable. However, I actually started my journey last month on 4/20/2021. So far, I have coded at least 1-2 hours a day.
